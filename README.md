This repository contains code for the [RatGTEx web portal](https://ratgtex.org), which provides gene expression and eQTL data for different rat tissues.

There are also repositories for the RatGTEx [data pipeline](https://github.com/daniel-munro/ratgtex-pipeline) and to [process those results](https://github.com/daniel-munro/ratgtex-server-data) for this site's API and visualizations.

### Using Jekyll to build the site

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the pages for each genome version.

### Using Rollup to bundle the visualization scripts

#### Rollup installation
To install Rollup and required libraries, you may run `npm install` in this directory. This will install the libraries under a subdirectory: `node_modules`.

#### Rollup configuration
The rollup configuration files for each visualization is located in the directory [src/rollup](/src/rollup). To recompile the code for a particular visualization, run the following command in this directory:

```shell
rollup -c src/rollup/rollup.expression-map.config.js
```

This will recompile and generate a new bundled visualization script in the directory `assets/js/`.
